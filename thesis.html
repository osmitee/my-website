        The Reverie Rooms is a rendition of my mindscape in an explorable, 360Â° space. It digitally morphs 3D space to depict the 5D reveries of the conscious mind, playing on the whimsical and ephemeral nature of carnivals + fun fairs to help fathom the intricacies of the mind. <br><br>
        
        The rooms take the idea of abstract minds and ethereal souls and apply it through Virtual Fantasy, a reimagination of VR. The carnival is a way promoting/advertising acceptance and understanding of every part of my life, bad and good, reclaiming the shackles of consumerism for my own mental wellbeing.
<bR><br>
        As of now, there are three rooms to explore: 
        <ol>
            <b><li>Come one, Come All!:</b> The Reverie Rooms' ticket stand, a representation of my mind's "waiting room," with a popcorn-cart of crumpled up ideas, a cotton-candy stall of whims, posters "advertising" the depths of my mind and tickets allowing us to explore them together.</li><bR>
            <b><li>Pop! the Bubble:</b> Balloon darts representing my mind during the early 2010s. The darts represent the realities of growing up that "pop the bubble" of childhood, with the surroundings depicting how my mind was at the time. A wall covered by Tumblr posts, sad music and romanticised sadness that overtook my mind. Worn out and forgotten toys as the prizes of growing up too fast. A sign with a double entendre, because in such games everybody wins, but at that time in our lives everybody's lost.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Tunnel O' Love:</b> Admits one, because this room is based in 2020-present and signifies self-love, recovery from mental anguish and the pursuit of happiness. The Clairvoyant's Lair represents the aid of spirituality in my life. The Wishing Booth provides hope, wish-fulfillment, manifestation like kisses at a kissing booth. The Confectionery of Joys represents finding my forgotten childhood, with candies of what I'd left behind.</li>
        </ol>
