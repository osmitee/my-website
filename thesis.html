        At 17, I was locked inside my mind, taking eternal residence in my room, trapped under blankets and lost hope. At 21,
        I’m stepping out into the world, making up for the childhood I was once so eager to get rid of and embracing
        independence.
        <br><br>
        Each era of my life was wildly different from the last; with such complexity, it became increasingly difficult to fathom
        the intricacies of my mind. I needed to explore it visually, and that’s where the idea of “The Reverie Rooms”
        originated.
        <br><br>
        “The Reverie Rooms” is a rendition of my mindscape in an explorable, 360° space. To promote the exploration of my mind
        while allowing its complexities to shine, the rooms play on carnival tropes—presenting the mindscape as a full-fledged,
        fantastical escapade, translating the ups-and-downs and functional anomalies of carnivals into a masquerade of
        metamorphosis. It guides you through the experience, each element representing a different era of my mind; balloons
        representing the bubble of innocence, stalls offering ideas and whims, a love tester measuring mental health recovery,
        and more!
        <br><br>
        While “The Reverie Rooms” is based on my life, it strives to promote acceptance and understanding of the evolution of
        anyone’s identity—be it through mental anguish or true happiness. It reimagines the correlation between mental and
        physical space by digitally morphing 3-D space to depict the 5-D reveries of the conscious mind.
